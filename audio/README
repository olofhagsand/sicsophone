This is the independent audio module in the Sicsophone.  The module
consists of different audio implementation. Every implementation needs
to plug in to the sicsophone buy obeying certain rules. This is
easiest described by illustrating the steps you need to make when
adding a new audio module to the sicsophone. This will be shown below.

Before you start, an audio module consists of a record and play
part. You may add only one, you do not need to add both, althoughthis
is most common. The play and record parts are completely independent
and should be placed in separate files.

Both the play and record modules have an api: play_api, and
record_api. They define a set of functions that each module have to
implement. The record_api has the following functions:
	init
	start
	poll
	ioctl
	exit

The play_api has the following functions:
	start
	play
	play_pos		       
	ioctl
	exit

A play API can either be a FIFO or SHBUF player. The former is easier
and need only implement a sub-set of the API.

To add a new audio module X, do the following:

1. Add the new module name in audio/sphone_audio_play.h: enum audio_type.

2. Add new files, for example, 
	sphone_audio_X_play.h
	sphone_audio_X_play.c
	sphone_audio_X_record.h
	sphone_audio_X_record.c
You can use existing modules as templates.

3. Add the .c files in the SRC variable in audio/Makefile.in

4. Edit the following files to call the init function for your new module:
	sphone_audio_play.c: audio_play_init()
	sphone_audio_record.c: audio_record_init()
