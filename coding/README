This is the independent coding module in the Sicsophone.  The module
consists of different coding implementation. Every implementation needs
to plug in to the sicsophone buy obeying certain rules. This is
easiest described by illustrating the steps you need to make when
adding a new coding module to the sicsophone. This will be shown below.

The coding modules have an api: coding_api defined in
coding/sphone_coding.h.  It defines a set of functions that each
module have to implement. The coding_api has the following functions:
	init
	encode
	decode
	encodelen
	decodelen
	sanity
	exit


To add a new coding module X, do the following:

1. Add the new module name in coding/sphone_coding.h: enum coding_type.

2. Add it in the mapping array coding_mapping in sphone_coding.c

3. Add new files, for example, 
	sphone_coding_X.h
	sphone_coding_X.c
You can use existing modules as templates.

4. Add the .c files in the SRC variable in coding/Makefile.in

5. Edit the following file to call the init function for your new module:
	sphone_coding.c: coding_init()
