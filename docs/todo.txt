1. Error Handling
-----------------
A general weak point. In particular, memory and file descriptor
cleanup - the code leaks quite a lot. In particular, the audio and
coding modules should be tightened since these are expected to grow
substantially.

Error handling in win32 directsound code is confused (DS_OK?, HRESULT?)

2. Misc
-------
More general channel handling.
Change coding dynamically

3. Coding
---------
Baastians coder.

5. GUI
------
gtk, graphics?

6. Signaling
------------
Yes, I know, but this is what everyone else is doing,...
I also think that H.323 and SIP sucks equally.

7. Windows
----------
autoconf stuff for visual-c++ (how much can you do?)
The directsound code needs tidying - looks awful.
