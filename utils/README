This directory contains utilities that are in some way related to the
sicsophone but not a central part of it.

The applications are:
	sps	- Sicsophone server
	spc	- Sicsophone client

The sicsophone server/client operation works as this: There is a
single server (sps). When the clients start, they register with the
server. The server maintains a list of clients that is updated
dynamically. The server initiates a phone conversation by selecting a
pair (sender, receiver) among the client list. The sender is notified
with a "start" message from the server. The sender sends a "req"
message to the receiver client, the receiver spawns a sicsophone
receiver and sends a "resp" message back. The sender client then
spawns a sicsophone sender. When the receiver sicsophone is done, the
receiver client dumps the data to the server, which in turn saves it
in a database.

Logfiles are constructed as follows:
